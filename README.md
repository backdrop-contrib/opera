# Opera

This is intended to be a contrib theme that will work for the Twin Cities Opera Guild project. We will create
both a theme and a sub-theme for this project. Our goal will be to keep as much as possible out of the sub-theme
and handled by the theme. 

The intention for this theme is that it is usable out of the box. This is not a theming framework, it should
be easy to use for end users with configuration options in the UI. However, it should also be well documented 
for users who wish to sub-theme it. 

# Goals

- Use Bootstrap Library
- Instructions for sub-theming
- Compatible with color module
- Provide default CSS files in simple CSS
- Provide a SASS starter kit for sub-theming
- Provide a straight CSS starter kit for sub-theming

# Instructions

One of the primary features of the Opera theme is the ability to build full-with layouts on the front page with 
custom background colors and hero images. 

1) Be sure to use the Boxton layout
2) Any blocks placed in content region of front page will automatically get assigned background colors based upon site color scheme
3) Choose from pre-defined color schemes in theme layout (or use color module to define your own)
