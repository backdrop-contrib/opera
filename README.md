# Opera

This is intended to be a contrib theme that will work for the Twin Cities Opera Guild project. We will create
both a theme and a sub-theme for this project. Our goal will be to keep as much as possible out of the sub-theme
and handled by the theme. 

The intention for this theme is that it is usable out of the box. This is not a theming framework, it should
be easy to use for end users with configuration options in the UI. However, it should also be well documented 
for users who wish to sub-theme it. 

# Goals

- Use Bootstrap Library
- Instructions for sub-theming
- Compatible with color module
- Provide default CSS files in simple CSS
- Provide a SASS starter kit for sub-theming
- Provide a straight CSS starter kit for sub-theming
